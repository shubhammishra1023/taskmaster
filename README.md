## Overview
Service Connect is a web application designed to bridge the gap between consumers and local service providersâ€”cooks, gardeners, plumbers, electricians, and more. By eliminating middlemen, the platform offers transparent, cost-effective, and direct communication for service booking and price negotiation.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup/login for consumers and service providers.
- **Profile Management**: Service providers can list expertise, availability, and rates; consumers can manage preferences and booking history.
- **Browse & Search**: Consumers can search for providers by category, skill, and proximity.
- **Direct Messaging**: In-app chat for direct negotiation of services and pricing.
- **Rating & Reviews**: Trust-building through feedback and star ratings.
- **Location-Based Services**: Geo-location integration to find nearby providers.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, reviews, and platform metrics.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (or PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth
